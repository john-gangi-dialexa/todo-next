# todo-next: understanding test-driven-developlment with react best practices

## todo-next: our best practices 101 project

a to-do list app is a great way to explore single-page application (SPA) best practices. by building a to-do list app with Next and React, you can learn how to manage application state, handle user interactions, and create dynamic interfaces. hopefully an emphasis on best practice will offer guidance on not only the features which make SPA applications but how to build them to be safe, secure, and behaving as expected.

1.**setting up the environment**

  software prequisites:
   - [vs code](<[vs](https://code.visualstudio.com)>), 
   - [git](https://git-scm.com), 
   - [node/npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) are already installed and that we'll be developing on mac hardwareâ€“though this is largely irrelevant.

verifiy node, git, npm:

```zsh
john@$ %: node -v
v18.7.0
john@$ %: npm -v
8.18.0
john@$ %: git --version
git version 2.32.1 (Apple Git-133)
```

**important note:** node is an extremely popular js runtime that is used create backend applications of all sizes, with its package manager node hosts one of the richest ecosystems for developers to jump-in and begin coding. (The sever-side magic of next is powered by node "under the hood") 

2.**initialize our first next app**

```zsh
mkdir todo-next && cd todo-next
git init
npx create-next-app . --ts --eslint --src-dir
```

you can see the placeholder application if you run: `npm run dev`



for now let's pair it down to this:

```tsx
import Image from 'next/image';
import styles from './page.module.css';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className={styles.main}>
      <div className={styles.description}>
        <p>
          <code>
            <h2>todo-next</h2>
            <br />
            <strong>welecome</strong> to the to-do list app.
            <br />
            <br />
            with simple HMTL markup
            <br />
            we can be begin to present
            <br />
            data for the web.
          </code>
        </p>
        <Image
              className={styles.logo}
              src="/laptop.svg"
              alt="laptop"
              fill={true}
            />
        <div>
          <a
            href="https://vercel.com?utm_source=create-next-app&utm_medium=appdir-template&utm_campaign=create-next-app"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
          ></a>
        </div>
      </div>
    </main>
  );
}
```

**important note:**you might notice that i have replaced the next placeholder images with [this laptop guy](https://github.com/john-gangi-dialexa/todo-next/blob/master/public/laptop.svg). that src path is rather laconic you say, that's because static files (like logos and midi theme songs) can easily be served this way by adding them to the /public directory of our next application!
